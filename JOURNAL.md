# 5/25/25: Worked on case.

Started making the case for the cyberdeck and also researched carrier board options.

# 5/27/25: Tried to make some sort of BOM.

I have been looking for parts for a while now. After making the Bom realized I'm going to have to sacrifice some features to stay in budget. I might try to integrate an old keyboard that I have instead of using the custom PCB I designed. Hopefully I can keep this thing under budget.

# 5/28/25: Changed the concept entirely!

In order to stay under budget, I decided to make a modular system with you being able to hotswap SBC and battery modules in and out of the deck. I mostly just did a lot of CAD.

# 6/2/25: Finished some modules!

I finished the battery module, and i also finished the lattepanda mu module. I started work on the rpi zero module and i added some visual flairs.

# 6/3/25: Finished designing!

Today, I started doing alot of finalization steps. I made the pi 5 module, I also have a module template for both the battery and compute now. And I did alot of fine tuning of the mounts and printability of the design. After all of that, I went back and changed the keyboard to use a pi pico to make my life easier when soldering and setting up firmware. The most annoying part of today was just doing all the little touches to make this thing actually be reasonable for others and myself to assemble in real life like adding screw posts and splitting parts in half.

# 6/4/25: started docs!

currently working on making instructions to build the project.

Check Readme.md for the progress

**Total time spent: 1h**

# 6/6/25: Worked on docs!

Wrote the assembly guide for the compute modules, batteries, and case. 

**Total time spent: 5h**

# 6/7/25: Worked on documentation and bom for every module 😢

Today I did a lot of writing. I wrote the assembly instructions for the remaining parts of the build, and i also wrote the bom with it being seperated to have individual costs for each module. 

**Total time spent: 5h**
