# Total time spent ~52 hours, (I think I forgot to log a few days and I dont remember what days ðŸ˜¢)
# 5/22/25: Starting project

I started and finished the keyboard pcb design!

**Total time spent: 9h**
# 5/25/25: Worked on case.

Started making the case for the cyberdeck and also researched carrier board options.

**Total time spent: 6h**

# 5/26/25: Worked on case.

Started designing mounts for the components in the case.

# 5/27/25: Tried to make some sort of BOM.

I have been looking for parts for a while now. After making the Bom realized I'm going to have to sacrifice some features to stay in budget. I might try to integrate an old keyboard that I have instead of using the custom PCB I designed. Hopefully I can keep this thing under budget.

**Total time spent: 4h**
# 5/28/25: Changed the concept entirely!

In order to stay under budget, I decided to make a modular system with you being able to hotswap SBC and battery modules in and out of the deck. I mostly just did a lot of CAD.

# 6/2/25: Finished some modules!

I finished the battery module, and i also finished the lattepanda mu module. I started work on the rpi zero module and i added some visual flairs.

# 6/3/25: Finished designing!

Today, I started doing alot of finalization steps. I made the pi 5 module, I also have a module template for both the battery and compute now. And I did alot of fine tuning of the mounts and printability of the design. After all of that, I went back and changed the keyboard to use a pi pico to make my life easier when soldering and setting up firmware. The most annoying part of today was just doing all the little touches to make this thing actually be reasonable for others and myself to assemble in real life like adding screw posts and splitting parts in half.

**Total time spent: 7h**

# 6/4/25: started docs!

currently working on making instructions to build the project.

Check Readme.md for the progress

**Total time spent: 1h**

# 6/6/25: Worked on docs!

Wrote the assembly guide for the compute modules, batteries, and case. 

**Total time spent: 5h**

# 6/7/25: Worked on documentation and bom for every module ðŸ˜¢

Today I did a lot of writing. I wrote the assembly instructions for the remaining parts of the build, and i also wrote the bom with it being seperated to have individual costs for each module. 

**Total time spent: 5h**

# 6/11/25: edited some bits on the bom bc the prices changed. 

The display price changed due to going off sale, and I also ordered all the parts.

**Total time spent: 2h**

# 6/12/25: Edited the pi zero compute module

When I was test fitting something was off (i dont remember i forgot to log this day this is retroactive looking at commits) so I edited the 3d model.

**Total time spent 1h**

# 6/13/25: Edited ports.

Every port on the model was the wrong size, so nothing fit. I changed all of them to fit with measurements from the components that arrived today. Then I re printed and rebuilt it again. 

**Total time spent 5h**

# 6/14/2025 I HATE RASPBERRY PI OS!!!!

Ok so today I was just messing with linux to try to get a pi zero to do anything useful on the desktop. I have realized that this will be a command line machine until I can build a more useful compute module. I also started building stuff with the new HDMI slots and mounted the ports. 

**Total time spent 6h**

#6/15/2025 I updated all the xt60 mounts to fit the connectors.

As the title says i edited the 3d model to fit the xt60s better.

**total time spent 2h**
